# vip_alert.rb (wip)

VipAlert is a ruby script that uses twillo to send you a text message when a message from someone important arrives in your gmail inbox. 
Right now its usable, but still a work in progress.

## Installation instructions

* Checkout the repository in your server 
* Bundle install
* Edit the config.yaml file and add your twillo info and VIP email address
* run vip_alert.rb thru a cron job. I have mine set to run every 5 minutes

## Planned features

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
